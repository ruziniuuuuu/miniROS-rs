# Introduction

Welcome to **miniROS-rs** - a lightweight, high-performance robotics middleware written in Rust. This documentation will guide you through everything you need to know to get started with miniROS-rs.

## What is miniROS-rs?

miniROS-rs is a modern robotics middleware that combines the core concepts of ROS2 with the performance and safety of Rust. It provides:

- **üöÄ High Performance**: Built with Rust for maximum speed and memory safety
- **üåê Flexible Communication**: Support for multiple transport protocols including UDP, TCP, and Zenoh
- **üìä Rich Visualization**: Integrated Rerun visualization for real-time data display
- **üîß Simple API**: Easy-to-use APIs inspired by ROS2 but designed for Rust
- **üéØ Minimal Footprint**: Lightweight design with only essential features

## Key Features

### Core Robotics Concepts
- **Nodes**: Independent processing units that can communicate with each other
- **Topics**: Named channels for asynchronous communication via publish/subscribe
- **Services**: Synchronous request/response communication patterns
- **Messages**: Strongly-typed data structures for safe communication

### Advanced Communication
